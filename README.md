# esp32-lua-libraries
Lua libraries for ESP32 that I find handy. These are all available inside the sample code at http://chilipeppr.com/esp32 which is a web IDE for ESP32 devices.

# ESP32 Websocket in pure Lua
A websocket client for ESP32 in pure Lua. This library is used by many other libraries in this sample code. The client is lightweight and has no dependencies 
other than the standard libraries available in the NodeMCU for ESP32 firmware that is also provided from the ChiliPeppr ESP32 workspace http://chilipeppr.com/esp32.
